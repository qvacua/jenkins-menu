Jenkins Menu
=============

A simple menu item for Mac OS X which shows the status of a Jenkins CI server.

Includes Growl support.  You can choose which notifications are reported via Growl's preferences.

Note that if you have builds that complete within Jenkins Menu's polling period (five minutes by default) then it may not notify you about the build.  You can always reduce the polling period in Jenkins Menu's Preferences.
